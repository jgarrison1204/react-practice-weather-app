# Weather App Using React

An simple application that takes a city name as an input and returns a 5 day weather forecast with detailed information for each day. This project is based on a final project from [React Training](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals-curriculum). 

## Installing

You will need to install `Node.js` and npm. Please follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for download and instructions. After nodejs is installed, clone this repo to your local computer. Use the command line to navigate to the project's root directory. Enter `npm start` to launch a localhost and view the application on the client. 

## Built With

* React.js
* React Router
* Bootstrap 4
* OpenWeather API
* Node.js

## Bugs

Still need to implement error handeling and a loading... component.
